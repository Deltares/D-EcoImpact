# VKZM (3D) case on water level and chloride policy

Based on the criteria set in the “Waterakkoord” by RWS the water level in Lake Volkerak is not allowed to exceed under normal conditions 0.15 m NAP or go lower than -0.10 m NAP. In addition to this threshold the chloride level should not exceed 450 mg/l (between mid-March and mid-September, as measured at “Bathse burg”). 
This case was simplified by testing that the chloride level does not exceed 450 mg/l at any moment in the year in the top layer of the model. The dry embankment area and islands included in the model were not excluded from assessment (hence is indicated as where water level is too high in the result).
